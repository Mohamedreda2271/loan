# loans-prediction-using-ML-and-DL
loans analysis and prediction using machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and deep learning models like ANN involve a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training, model evaluation, and model testing and deployment. The specific techniques used will depend on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis. The advantage of using deep learning models is that they can often capture complex relationships between the loan application features, leading to improved accuracy and better loan approval decisions.
